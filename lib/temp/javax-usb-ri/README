The JSR80 web site is: http://javax-usb.org

****************
* Requirements *
****************

Java      Standard Edition version 1.2 or greater - Micro Edition has not been tested but may work
ANT       http://jakarta.apache.org/ant

JSR80 API You must have the API classfiles/jar in your CLASSPATH.

Note that pre-installed versions of these tools may not be right, e.g. some distros have "Kaffe"
or "gcc-java" or another version of ant.  Those packages should be replaced/removed.

This "common" implementation contains code that implements the javax.usb API but is not platform-specific.
Therefore, it requires a (usually small) platform-specific implementation as well.  The platform
implementation should also provide the API-required properties file (see the API README for details).
This common implementation supports additional properties and a sample template properties file is
provided in the docs/ directory.

*********
* Build *
*********

The ANT tool uses XML buildfiles to create the project.  Run ant in
the toplevel directory to list all available targets.

To create JavaDOC with the API source as well, set your environement variable
JSR80_RI_JDOC_PATH to the src/ directory from the API package.

****************
* Installation *
****************

Add lib/jsr80_ri.jar to your CLASSPATH.
